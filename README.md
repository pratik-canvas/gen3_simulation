# Gen3 Odometry in Simulation

## Description

A Gazebo based simulation of the Gen3 robot which can be teleoperated with an Xbox controller. The slip compensated odometry is generated by dynamic slip ratio estimation. Ground truth and the predicted odometry is plotted for comparision. 

### Dependecies

* Update Gazebo from OSRF for latest plugins

```

sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list'
wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrage

```

### Installing

* git clone the repo into a working catkin_ws/src
* catkin_make at the catkin_ws


## Joystick setup
* Connect Joystick to the computer and enter
```
ls /dev/input/
```
* Ensure the joystick is functional by running 
```
sudo jstest /dev/input/jsX
```
X:integer as seen from previous command

* Make joystick acessible to ROS
```
ls -l /dev/input/jsX
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/input/jsX
```


### Executing program

```
roslaunch gen3_bringup simulation.launch
```
